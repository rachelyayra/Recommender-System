# Movie Recommender System

This repository contains a simple movie recommender system that utilizes various features such as keywords, genres, cast, and directors to provide movie recommendations. The system is designed to analyze and suggest movies based on user preferences, enhancing the movie-watching experience.

## Dataset

The dataset used for building the movie recommender system was obtained online and contains comprehensive information about movies, including keywords, genres, cast, and directors. The dataset serves as the foundation for training the recommender system's algorithms.

## Future Work

While the initial implementation focuses on movie recommendations, this repository aims to extend its capabilities to the field of music recommendation. By adapting the existing framework and incorporating relevant audio features, we intend to provide personalized music suggestions based on user preferences.
